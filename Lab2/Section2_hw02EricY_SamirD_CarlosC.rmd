## Introduction

The dataset includes, for each record, information such as:

* Donation amounts for the last 4 years
* Whether they attended the contribution events between 2012 and 2015
* Year of graduation
* Marital status, Gender
* Major of studies
* Year of graduation

Given that the goal of this study is to be able to predict who are likely to donate and the magnitude of that donation, we build a model focusing on its predictive power rather than its explanatory power. To build our model, in the following sections we thoroughly analyze the data, afterwards consider both multinomial and ordinal models and conduct statistical analysis on them to choose the one most fit for the required predictions.
