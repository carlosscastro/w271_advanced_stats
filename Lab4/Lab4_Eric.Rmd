## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Read in Data
```{r}
library(xts)
library(tseries)
library(forecast)

ts_data = read.csv('Lab4-series2.csv')
head(ts_data)
length(ts_data[,1])

ts_id <- seq(as.Date("1990/1/1"), by = "month", length.out = 311)
tail(ts_id)

xts_data <- xts(ts_data$x, order.by = ts_id)
tail(xts_data)

colnames(xts_data) = 'x'
```

#Explore Data
```{r}
plot(xts_data$x, type = 'l', main = 'time series data')
#I see both trend and seasonality in the data.  Looks like we peak in the beginning of the year and decline by the end of the year.  Alrternating positive/negative trends in ~5-7 year intervals.

monthplot(xts_data$x)
#Month plot confirms that Q1 does average higher than the rest of the year.  We also see somewhat of an increase in July

plot(rnorm(300, mean = 6), type = 'l', main = 'stationary example reference')
#randomly distributed plot shows the difference between the data

#plot(diff(train$x)[2:300], type = 'l', main = 'first difference time series data')
#Taking the first difference appears to create a more stationary series

acf(xts_data$x, 120)
#Gradual suggest an AR(1) model

#acf(diff(train$x)[2:300])
#ACF of first difference does not result in white noise meaning that this is not a random walk.  Also note that the first different does not result in stationary data.

#acf(diff(diff(train$x)[2:300])[2:299])
#Second Difference data is still not stationary.  Does this mean we need a seasonal model?

pacf(xts_data$x, 120)
#There are multiple significant lags for the PACF.  Lags 1,4,7,10,11,13

adf.test(xts_data$x)
#Dicky Fuller test is unable to reject the null hypothesis that the data is non stationary.  More evidence of what we've already seen in acf/pacf and differencing of data.


#Try Seasonal Differencing here


```
```{r}

length(xts_data)
#EDA Continued
#Try Seasonal Differencing Here
x.yd = diff(xts_data$x, lag =12)[13:311]

plot(x.yd, main = 'Yearly Difference Plot')
#We still see a trend but seasonality looks like its been removed to a degree.

monthplot(x.yd)
#Taking the seasonal difference gives us an almost flat mean for each month.  Seems like this has deseasoned the data well.  Big D = 1

acf(x.yd, 48)
#The acf still looks like a random walk based on the gradual decrease in acf

pacf(x.yd, 48)
#Lags at 13 and 37?  Not sure how to interpret this

x.yd.df = diff(x.yd)[2:299]

plot(x.yd.df, main = 'D=1, d=1 time series')
#Plot looks much more stationary

monthplot(x.yd.df)
#Month plot still appears relatively stationary however less so then jsut using the seasonal difference

acf(x.yd.df, 120)
#Acf looks much more stationary now with the second difference.  Last meaningful spike around lag 5

pacf(x.yd.df, 120)
#We see a spike for multiples of 12 (yearly) up to 60, 5 yearly lags
